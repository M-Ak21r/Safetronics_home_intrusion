# Ultralytics YOLO ByteTrack Configuration
# Optimized for persistent object tracking with reduced box flickering

tracker_type: bytetrack

# ByteTrack parameters optimized for stability
track_high_thresh: 0.5    # Threshold for detection to start new track
track_low_thresh: 0.1     # Lower threshold for matching existing tracks (reduced to keep tracking)
new_track_thresh: 0.6     # Threshold to create new track (higher to avoid duplicates)
track_buffer: 60          # Increased buffer to maintain tracks longer during occlusions
match_thresh: 0.8         # Matching threshold for track association
fuse_score: True          # Fuse detection score with track score
